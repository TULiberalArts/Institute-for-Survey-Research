## [Study Design & Methodology](www.develop.cla.temple.edu/isr/services/study-design-and-methodology)
ISR staff works with clients to design data collection efforts for qualitative and quantitative studies that involve human subjects research. We have experience in questionnaire development, semi-structured interview protocols for focus groups or interviews, cognitive testing of instruments for reading level and overall comprehension, pilot testing pre-existing instruments. We also have experience with bi-lingual instruments, translation and back-translation. We work on cross-sectional and longitudinal data collection efforts as well as program evaluations. 

## [Sampling Design & Recruitment](www.develop.cla.temple.edu/isr/services/sampling-design-and-recruitment)
We help clients design the most efficient and cost-effective sample selection strategies, including probability-based designs such as dual-frame telephone and address-based sampling plans as well as non-probability-based designs such as convenience, snowball, intercept studies.

In addition, ISR owns and operates BeHeardPhilly a multi-mode panel that includes 9500+ Philadelphians who have opted-in and agreed to be surveyed. Panel members have been recruited via probability and multiple non-probability methods. Panel members opt their preferred mode of response which includes phone, web and SMS and they opt the number of times they are willing to be surveyed in a given year. We continue to grow the panel by targeting recruitment methods for heard to reach populations. 

ISR uses a consultant sampling statistician for complex sampling designs, post-stratification weighting and computation of adjusted standard errors. 

## [Data Collection](www.develop.cla.temple.edu/isr/services/data-collection) 
ISR is a full-service data collection shop and has as in-house 35-seat call center where we conduct computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) using CASES. We also have experience with computer-assisted in-person interviewing (CAPI), and audio computer-assisted self-interviewing (ACASI). We have conducted mail, web, face-to-face field, and SMS surveys. We specialize in multi-mode surveys and offer push-to-web options for all surveys. We can recruit subjects and run focus groups for any study and have experience in mock-jury research. In addition, we specialize in respondent tracking and tracing for longitudinal studies. ISR also has interactive voice recognition (IVR) capabilities. 

## Data Processing
ISR has data entry, coding, and validation capabilities. We use in-house, high quality digital recording and video equipment and use a third-party transcription service for interview and focus group audio files.  

## Analysis & Reporting
ISR can provide quantitative and qualitative data analyses, statistical modeling and reports. In-house we use SPSS, SAS, and NVivo, and can refer consultation with Stata and R. Report graphics are generated with Tableau and dashboard technology Domo. 
 
## Information Technology
With a full-time systems engineer, ISR can provide database design and management, application design and development, medical and legal data extraction. Our data management plan can be found here. (insert link to our data management plan). In addition, ISR has developed a proprietary multi-mode panel management system that can be purchased via a SaaS license.
