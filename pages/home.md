Founded in 1967, Temple University Institute for Survey Research (ISR) is one of the oldest and most prestigious academic survey research centers in the U.S., with now more than 50 years of experience conducting national, state, and local surveys, statistical research, focus group research, needs assessments and program evaluations. ISR occupies 12,000 feet of newly renovated space in the ECEC building on Cecil B. Moore that includes a 35-seat call center.

We are known for the consistently high quality of our work, our high response rates, and our expertise and success in tracing longitudinal study participants. We have much experience working with communities of color, data collection in under-resourced neighborhoods and transient populations.
