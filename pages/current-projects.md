## The Role of Automated SMS Text Messaging in Public Opinion Research
![Textizen]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized Textizen_logo_blue.png){:.img-right}
This project examines the response to a series of automated SMS text messages used as a “primary” mode of data collection. A sample of 1,000 mobile subscribers was contacted via a “cold text” asking them to participate in a 5-question survey regarding their opinion on a local park; a raffle of 10 iPads was offered as incentives. Non-respondents received follow-up phone calls to determine their reason(s) for not responding, such as a non-working number, the inability to receive text messages, non-interest in text-message survey participation, or invasion of privacy.

![Indego Bike Share]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized Indego Logo.png){:.img-right}
Philadelphia, currently the last major city in the Northeast without a bike sharing system, will launch its own program starting in the spring of 2015. First, in the fall of 2014, ISR conducted focus groups with residents to determine how to make the new bike share program accessible, useful, and interesting to all residents of the City. Currently, as the Bike Share program prepares to launch, ISR will evaluate the impact of Bike Share outreach efforts.

![Menhood]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized menhood little.jpg){:.img-right}
In collaboration with researchers at The George Washington University, ISR is currently managing all data collection efforts for a study investigating how factors such as poverty, racial discrimination, incarceration, crime and neighborhood values relate to Black men’s sexual risk behaviors with their sexual partners in Washington, D.C. Prior to launch, ISR supported instrument design through cognitive interviews and pretesting.

## National Evaluation of Community-Based Violence Prevention Program
In collaboration with John Jay College and Temple University, ISR conducted pre- and post-intervention in-person computer assisted surveys with over 1,200 residents in four selected treatment and control communities in Colorado and New York. ISR’s data collection support is for a comprehensive outcomes evaluation project for Ceasefire, an evidence-based intervention of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention.

## Tobacco Information Signs Street Intercept Surveys
This baseline survey was conducted in four neighborhoods in Philadelphia selected by the Philadelphia Department of Public Health to represent areas with high smoking rates in the city. ISR surveyed 400 Philadelphia residents on the street near entrances to stores that sell tobacco products.The survey confirms the findings of preliminary research indicating that knowledge is weak about smoking’s effects on cancer in 10 different parts of the body, but knowledge about lung cancer is high.

## Pediatric PROMIS: Advancing the Measurement and Conceptualization of Child Health
ISR collects data for The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia PROMIS Norming initiative via programming and monitoring IVR system. Data collection consists of creating an IVR survey for 4,000 parent child dyads for voice verification. Parent-child dyads (children aged 8-17 years and their parents) are asked to complete a short interactive voice recorded (IVR) survey (managed by ISR) upon completion of the primary online survey (managed by GfK-an online panel survey company). ISR’s role is to attempt to validate the legitimacy of the panel dyads.

## A Pediatric Quality Measurement Center and Testing Laboratory
ISR collects data for CHOP’s Clinical Validation of Pediatric Global Health Scale via telephone survey with a multimodal sequential recruit and survey at three points for 1,000 parent child dyads. Data collection consists of a baseline survey, 1 month follow-up and 6-12 week follow-up with client-provided list sample. A countable dyad complete requires both parent and child to complete the interview at each wave.
